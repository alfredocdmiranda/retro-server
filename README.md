# retro-server
Retro Server is libretro-based emulation server. It is in PoC stage, however, it aims to solve an issue that I faced 
years ago (and I believe many people) that is running some emulators in low devices.

## Goals

- [ ] Run one game exchanging data between Client and Server with one player
- [ ] Allow user connect and disconnect from the session without crashing
- [ ] Allow multiple clients

## Projects

Here is a couple of projects that are helping me to study and bring this idea to life.

- [libretro] (https://github.com/libretro)
- [miniretro](https://github.com/davidgfnet/miniretro)
- [nanoarch] (https://github.com/heuripedes/nanoarch)
